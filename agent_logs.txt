I've uploaded a python code repository in the directory /testbed (not in /tmp/inputs). Consider the following PR description:

<pr_description>
Modeling's `separability_matrix` does not compute separability correctly for nested CompoundModels
Consider the following model:

```python
from astropy.modeling import models as m
from astropy.modeling.separable import separability_matrix

cm = m.Linear1D(10) & m.Linear1D(5)
```

It's separability matrix as you might expect is a diagonal:

```python
>>> separability_matrix(cm)
array([[ True, False],
       [False,  True]])
```

If I make the model more complex:
```python
>>> separability_matrix(m.Pix2Sky_TAN() & m.Linear1D(10) & m.Linear1D(5))
array([[ True,  True, False, False],
       [ True,  True, False, False],
       [False, False,  True, False],
       [False, False, False,  True]])
```

The output matrix is again, as expected, the outputs and inputs to the linear models are separable and independent of each other.

If however, I nest these compound models:
```python
>>> separability_matrix(m.Pix2Sky_TAN() & cm)
array([[ True,  True, False, False],
       [ True,  True, False, False],
       [False, False,  True,  True],
       [False, False,  True,  True]])
```
Suddenly the inputs and outputs are no longer separable?

This feels like a bug to me, but I might be missing something?

Can you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?
I've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!

Your task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.

Follow these steps to resolve the issue:
1. As a first step, it would be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.
2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the BashTool, to confirm the error
3. Use the sequential_thinking tool to plan your fix. Reflect on 5-7 different possible sources of the problem, distill those down to 1-2 most likely sources, and then add logs to validate your assumptions before moving onto implementing the actual code fix
4. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue
5. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!
6. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well
7. Run select tests from the repo to make sure that your fix doesn't break anything else.


GUIDE FOR HOW TO USE "sequential_thinking" TOOL:
- Your thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long. Set totalThoughts to at least 5, but setting it up to 25 is fine as well. You'll need more total thoughts when you are considering multiple possible solutions or root causes for an issue.
- Use this tool as much as you find necessary to improve the quality of your answers.
- You can run bash commands (like tests, a reproduction script, or 'grep'/'find' to find relevant context) in between thoughts.
- The sequential_thinking tool can help you break down complex problems, analyze issues step-by-step, and ensure a thorough approach to problem-solving.
- Don't hesitate to use it multiple times throughout your thought process to enhance the depth and accuracy of your solutions.

TIPS:
- You must make changes in the /testbed directory in order to ensure the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met. Leaving the directory unchanged is not a valid solution.
- Do NOT make tool calls inside thoughts passed to sequential_thinking tool. For example, do NOT do this: {'thought': 'I need to look at the actual implementation of `apps.get_models()` in this version of Django to see if there's a bug. Let me check the Django apps module:

<function_calls>
<invoke name="str_replace_editor">
<parameter name="command">view</parameter>
<parameter name="path">django/apps/registry.py</parameter></invoke>', 'path': 'django/apps/registry.py'}
- Respect the tool specifications. If a field is required, make sure to provide a value for it. For example "thoughtNumber" is required by the sequential_thinking tool.
- When you run "ls" with the bash tool, the "view" command with the "str_replace_editor" tool, or variants of those, you may see a symlink like "fileA -> /home/augment/docker/volumes/_data/fileA". You can safely ignore the symlink and just use "fileA" as the path when read, editing, or executing the file.
- When you need to find information about the codebase, use "grep" and "find" to search for relevant files and code with the bash tool
- Use your bash tool to set up any necessary environment variables, such as those needed to run tests.

Top-level agent planning next step: Now that we've confirmed the issue, let's use the sequential_thinking tool to analyze the problem and plan a fix:

Calling tool sequential_thinking with input:
 - thought: Let me analyze the issue with the separability_matrix function for nested CompoundModels. 

From the PR description and our reproduction script, we can see that when we have a nested compound model (Pix2Sky_TAN() & cm, where cm is Linear1D(10) & Linear1D(5)), the separability matrix shows that the inputs and outputs are not separable, which is incorrect.

The expected behavior would be that the separability matrix should show the same pattern as when we explicitly write out the full model without nesting (Pix2Sky_TAN() & Linear1D(10) & Linear1D(5)).

Let me first understand how the separability matrix is calculated in the code.

}



--------------------------------------------- NEW TURN ---------------------------------------------

(Current token count: 7303)

Calling tool sequential_thinking with input:
 - thought: Looking at the code, the main function is `separability_matrix(transform)` which calls `_separable(transform)` to do the actual work. The `_separable` function has a few key parts:

1. It first checks if the model has a `_calculate_separability_matrix()` method that returns something other than NotImplemented. If so, it uses that.
2. If the model is a CompoundModel, it recursively calls `_separable` on the left and right parts of the model, and then combines them using the appropriate operator function from the `_operators` dictionary.
3. If the model is a simple Model, it calls `_coord_matrix` to create a matrix representing the inputs and outputs.

For the '&' operator (which is used in our test cases), the `_cstack` function is called to combine the left and right matrices. This function:
1. Computes the total number of outputs
2. Converts the left and right models to coordinate matrices if they are not already
3. Stacks these matrices horizontally

The issue might be in how nested compound models are handled during this process.

}



--------------------------------------------- NEW TURN ---------------------------------------------

(Current token count: 7724)

Calling tool sequential_thinking with input:
 - thought: Let's look more closely at the `_cstack` function, which is used for the '&' operator. This function is responsible for combining the separability matrices of two models that are combined with the '&' operator.

```python
def _cstack(left, right):
    noutp = _compute_n_outputs(left, right)

    if isinstance(left, Model):
        cleft = _coord_matrix(left, 'left', noutp)
    else:
        cleft = np.zeros((noutp, left.shape[1]))
        cleft[: left.shape[0], : left.shape[1]] = left
    if isinstance(right, Model):
        cright = _coord_matrix(right, 'right', noutp)
    else:
        cright = np.zeros((noutp, right.shape[1]))
        cright[-right.shape[0]:, -right.shape[1]:] = 1  # <-- This line looks suspicious

    return np.hstack([cleft, cright])
```

I notice something suspicious: when `right` is not a Model (i.e., it's already a matrix), the code sets all elements in the bottom-right part of the matrix to 1, regardless of what the actual values in `right` are. This seems wrong - it should be copying the values from `right`, not setting them all to 1.

This could be the source of the issue. When we have a nested compound model, the inner compound model (cm) gets processed first, and its separability matrix is correctly calculated. But when this matrix is then used as the right operand in the outer compound model, the `_cstack` function ignores its actual values and sets all elements to 1.

--------------------------------------------- NEW TURN ---------------------------------------------

(Current token count: 8814)

Calling tool sequential_thinking with input:
 - thought: The debug output confirms our suspicion. Let's look at what's happening:

1. First, the inner compound model (cm = Linear1D(10) & Linear1D(5)) is processed, and the result is a 2x2 matrix with ones on the diagonal:
   ```
   [[1. 0.]
    [0. 1.]]
   ```

2. Then, when processing the outer compound model (Pix2Sky_TAN() & cm), the _cstack function is called with:
   - left: The separability matrix for Pix2Sky_TAN(), which is a 2x2 matrix of all ones (since Pix2Sky_TAN is not separable)
   - right: The separability matrix for cm, which is our 2x2 diagonal matrix

3. But in the _cstack function, when handling the right operand, it ignores the actual values in the right matrix and sets all elements in the bottom-right part of the result to 1:
   ```python
   cright = np.zeros((noutp, right.shape[1]))
   cright[-right.shape[0]:, -right.shape[1]:] = 1  # <-- This is the problem
   ```

This is why we end up with a matrix where the bottom-right quadrant is all ones, instead of preserving the diagonal structure from the inner compound model.

The fix should be to copy the actual values from the right matrix, not set them all to 1:
 - nextThoughtNeeded: True
 - thoughtNumber: 5
 - totalThoughts: 10
Tool output: 
{
  "thoughtNumber": 5,

Calling tool sequential_thinking with input:
 - thought: Let's look at the fix. We need to change this line in the `_cstack` function:

```python
cright = np.zeros((noutp, right.shape[1]))
cright[-right.shape[0]:, -right.shape[1]:] = 1  # <-- This is the problem
```

to:

```python
cright = np.zeros((noutp, right.shape[1]))
cright[-right.shape[0]:, -right.shape[1]:] = right  # <-- Copy the actual values from right
```

This should preserve the separability information from the inner compound model when it's used as part of a larger compound model.

Let's also consider if there are any other places in the code that might have similar issues. The `_cdot` function, which is used for the '|' operator, doesn't seem to have this issue because it directly uses the matrices in a dot product without modifying them.

Let's implement this fix and test it.

Let's review what we did:

1. We identified that the issue was in the `_cstack` function, which is used to combine separability matrices for models combined with the '&' operator.
2. The problem was that when the right operand was already a matrix (not a Model), the function was ignoring its actual values and setting all elements in the bottom-right part of the result to 1.
3. We fixed this by changing the line to copy the actual values from the right matrix instead.

This fix ensures that the separability information from nested compound models is preserved when they are used as part of larger compound models.

Let's run some tests to make sure we haven't broken anything else.

Calling tool sequential_thinking with input:
 - thought: The edge cases are all working correctly:

1. The deeply nested compound model has the same separability matrix as the equivalent non-nested model, which is what we want.
2. The mixed separable/non-separable nested model correctly shows that the non-separable Polynomial2D affects both of its inputs (the middle part of the matrix has True in both columns).
3. The complex nesting with different operators also works correctly.

Our fix is working well for all these cases. Let's summarize what we did:

1. We identified the issue in the `_cstack` function in `astropy/modeling/separable.py`. When handling the right operand that was already a matrix (not a Model), it was ignoring the actual values in the matrix and setting all elements in the bottom-right part of the result to 1.

2. We fixed this by changing:
   ```python
   cright[-right.shape[0]:, -right.shape[1]:] = 1
   ```
   to:
   ```python
   cright[-right.shape[0]:, -right.shape[1]:] = right
   ```

3. This ensures that the separability information from nested compound models is preserved when they are used as part of larger compound models.

4. We verified that the fix works for the specific case mentioned in the PR description, as well as for more complex edge cases.

5. We also ran the existing tests to make sure we didn't break anything else, and all tests passed.

The fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue, and it correctly handles all the test cases we've tried. I believe this is the right solution for the problem described in the PR.

 - thought: Let's do one final check to make sure our fix is correct. The issue was that when we had a nested compound model, the separability information from the inner model was lost. Our fix ensures that this information is preserved.

Let's look at the original examples from the PR description again:

1. `cm = m.Linear1D(10) & m.Linear1D(5)` - This should have a diagonal separability matrix, which it does.
2. `m.Pix2Sky_TAN() & m.Linear1D(10) & m.Linear1D(5)` - This should have a specific pattern, which it does.
3. `m.Pix2Sky_TAN() & cm` - This should have the same pattern as example 2, which it now does after our fix.

Our fix is simple and focused on the specific issue. We identified that the problem was in the `_cstack` function, which was not correctly handling the case where the right operand was already a matrix. By changing one line of code, we fixed the issue without introducing any regressions.

I believe this is the correct solution for the problem described in the PR.

Calling tool complete with input:
 - answer: I've successfully fixed the issue with the `separability_matrix` function not computing separability correctly for nested CompoundModels.

## The Problem
When a CompoundModel was nested inside another CompoundModel using the `&` operator, the separability information from the inner model was lost. This was happening because in the `_cstack` function, when handling a right operand that was already a matrix (not a Model), it was ignoring the actual values in the matrix and setting all elements in the bottom-right part of the result to 1.

## The Fix
I identified the issue in the `_cstack` function in `astropy/modeling/separable.py`. The problem was in this line:
```python
cright[-right.shape[0]:, -right.shape[1]:] = 1  # Setting all elements to 1 regardless of actual values
```

I changed it to:
```python
cright[-right.shape[0]:, -right.shape[1]:] = right  # Copy the actual values from right
```

This ensures that the separability information from nested compound models is preserved when they are used as part of larger compound models.

## Verification
I created several test scripts to verify the fix:

1. First, I reproduced the issue described in the PR:
   - `cm = m.Linear1D(10) & m.Linear1D(5)` - This has a diagonal separability matrix
   - `m.Pix2Sky_TAN() & m.Linear1D(10) & m.Linear1D(5)` - This has a specific pattern
   - `m.Pix2Sky_TAN() & cm` - Before the fix, this had a different pattern than the equivalent non-nested model. After the fix, they match.

2. I tested more complex edge cases:
   - Deeply nested compound models
   - Mixed separable/non-separable nested models
   - Complex nesting with different operators

3. I ran the existing tests to ensure I didn't break anything else:
   - All tests in `test_separable.py` pass
   - All compound model tests in `test_core.py` pass

The fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue. By changing just one line of code, I fixed the issue without introducing any regressions.

## Summary
The fix ensures that when compound models are nested, their separability information is correctly preserved in the final separability matrix. This matches the expected behavior described in the PR description.
